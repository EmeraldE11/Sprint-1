Name: Noah McCarthy

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? - Sprint 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:


Unique Requirements & Stretch Challenges
Write software to analyze a set of data to answer two questions about that data as detailed below:
Find a free dataset that interests you.

Identify the two questions about the dataset on your own. You might change your questions after you explore the data further.

Write a program in any programming language using a statistics library (e.g. R or Python Pandas) to analyze the dataset and provide an answer to your questions.

You must demonstrate the ability to do one or more of the following to achieve each answer: filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or data conversion.

Guidance
You should consider using Python and Pandas for this module. You should also consider using Kaggle to obtain a free dataset. Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:

You need to install Pandas on your computer. You can use pip to install: pip install pandas.

You can download a dataset from Kaggle.com. You should look for a dataset that has good documentation, which will help you understand the data.

Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:

Pandas 10 Minute Tutorial (official site)

Pandas Getting Started Tutorials (official site)

Pandas Example with Titanic Data (tutorial site)

Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas (tutorial site)



### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html
https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-to-data-analysis-with-python-pandas-with-titanic-dataset-a195ab043c77
https://www.kaggle.com/code/kashnitsky/topic-1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas
https://www.w3schools.com/python/
https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp


2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
Learn Panda first since I'm fully unfamiliar with it. After finding a dataset, build doink around with Pandas until I have a better understanding. Then prototype code to practice code for sorting and filtering, using resources to help me know the content I need for success.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
I plan to have a software that allows me to pull up the highest rated games based on user input so you can compare results from different genres, time frames, and more.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
My main study place will be my housing's clubhouse. My room or somewhere in the STC are my backup options if the clubhouse isn't available.
I plan to work on my module:
Monday afternoon, around 1 or 2
Thursday afternoon, around 1 or 2
Friday evening, around 5 or 6
any extra needed time on Saturday

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
A technical risk would be finding the correct way to get the file data to interact with the program. I plan to use barebones code at first to streamline the debugging process before adding more complexity. A behavioral risk I see is getting caught up with other deadlines I have and forgetting to set aside time for this module, so I'm going to set alarms to remind me about the info I put in no. 4.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|

N/A

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
N/A

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      10:00        |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
I was able to troubleshoot well, and naturally find the separations in functions.
My biggest trouble was figuring out time to work on it, Github, and finding ways to incorporate some of the smaller edge cases.
